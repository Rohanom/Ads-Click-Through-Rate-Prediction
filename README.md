# 📢 Ads Click Through Rate Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting whether users will click on advertisements based on their characteristics and behaviors. **Click-through rate (CTR)** is a crucial metric in digital advertising that measures the ratio of users who click on an ad to the total number of users who view it. This project analyzes user data to identify patterns and build a predictive model that can help advertisers target their audience more effectively.
